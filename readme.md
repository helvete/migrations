Differences over Nextras
-------

1. Allow to set effective role under which the migrations are run against the database. This change is essential to support postgres group ACL mode.
1. Allow out-of-order migrations execution. This alteration is useful in case of many environments having various branch lifetime while vast majority of migrations is simply additive.
